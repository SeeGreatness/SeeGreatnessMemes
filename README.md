This is just a resource for my website that people can add a image src url link to a memes

#how to add a meme a step by step guide
PLEASE CHECK THE memes.json FILE FIRST TO SEE IF YOUR MEME IS IN THEIR
if you dont want to do this then i recomend sending more than 10 because....
you dont have to do this if you are sending more than 10 memes at a time in one JSON set 
If you are just sending one or two at a time you dont need to convert it to json all i need is the link 
you can send that link to me on discord SeeGreatness#0420

If you are converting to json please follow this step by step guide below!

1) aquire the url of the image..
2)convert it to json by puting it in the template below
{
"NUMBER":"URL",
"NUMBER+1":"URL",
"NUMBER+1":"URL"
}
number must bea number that is incremented with each list for example
{
"1":"https://tinyurl.com/memeone",
"2":"https://tinyurl.com/memetwo",
"3":"https://tinyurl.com/memethree"
}
Url must be the image url of the meme, I recomend using tinyurl to make your urls tiny and so you can send the code to me on discord! without going over the character count!

Watch your commas
each list must end with a comma , UNLESS its the last line! in that case you dont need one

you dont need three lists you can use more or less
{
"1":"https://tinyurl.com/memeone",
"2":"https://tinyurl.com/memeone",
"3":"https://tinyurl.com/memeone",
"4":"https://tinyurl.com/memeone"
}

3) Send the Json to me via discord SeeGreatness#0420 as a DM
